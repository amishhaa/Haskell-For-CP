# Haskell Competitive Programming Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various **competitive programming** problems, implemented in **Haskell**. The goal of this project is to solve algorithmic challenges while exploring the expressive power and elegance of Haskell, a purely functional programming language.

## Purpose

Competitive programming pushes problem-solving skills to the next level by involving complex algorithms and data structures. By using Haskell, I aim to:

- Enhance problem-solving skills in a functional paradigm.
- Showcase how Haskell can be leveraged to write concise and efficient solutions.
- Experiment with Haskell's unique features like lazy evaluation, immutability, and pattern matching to approach problems differently than imperative languages.
